# Project2-Bank.app
A learning tool to teach the user the affects of saving at an inputted variables. 
I would have created

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This project was design to show gwroth of an an investement over time.
  after showing the user variables that are used in calculations. Users can put in values for each variable and see a report for growth.
  
What did you do particularly well?
  I felt my use of fucntions on a implementation file was the best. My code had minium lines in the main function
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I would have liked to use classes in my code. I would have also like to have a class for Dispaly, A class for calculations. This would have made my code a little easier to read and update.
  
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  at the time classes. for some od reason I could not get the class to console output anything. Once I learned how to uses classes, it seemed really easy to create variables. performed. Planing the code. I over think the Puesdo Code. and I need to learn how to better break down 
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  I feel most of the skills used on this project were transferable. How ever I think the one 
  
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I used formulas. I aimed to keep the line of code less than 20 lines of code. not inclueding spaces and notes. I added notes to every section of my code. what does what. even my thoughts at the time when i learned/tried something new.
